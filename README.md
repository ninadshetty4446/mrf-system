# OPTIMISATION OF MIXING TANK USING MULTIPLE REFERENCE FRAME (MRF) APPROACH IN CFD SIMULATION
This project mainly aims at investigating the fluid dynamics inside a mixing tank, commonly used in various industries such as chemical, pharmaceutical, and wastewater treatment plants and optimize its working through CFD simulations.
 The objective is to understand the flow patterns and performance within these tanks to optimize their design and minimize operational costs.
Multiple Reference Frames (MRF) are used to simulate fluid flow around rotating components or systems. It analyzes flow fields in turbine, pump, and fan systems. MRF divides the rotating region into stationary reference frames for each rotating component.
